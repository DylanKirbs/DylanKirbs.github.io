<p>As mentioned in my previous post (<a href="/starting-off/" data-type="post" data-id="30">starting off</a>), this isn&#8217;t my first website. Nor, do I expect will it be the last. Now, I must disclaim that web development is not my strong suite, but I am extremely adaptive and resourceful.</p>



<p>My previous site was hosted on GitHub pages, so I was fairly familiar with what was involved, but I was using Jekyll to build the site from Markdown documents. The biggest challenge for me was getting the style right, and I couldn&#8217;t quite figure it out. This frustration let me to look for something different.</p>



<p>I have a background in WordPress, doing work for a non-profit organisation based out of Cape Town, South Africa. So I decided that it would be an easy enough way for me to start my endeavour. But I still wanted to host it on GitHub pages. I don&#8217;t know why I decided this, but I did.</p>



<p>So here we are, a WordPress site that has been statically generated and pushed to a GitHub repository.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s always a good thing to have a personal brand. What better way to present yourself in the modern day and age than with a personal website.</p>



<p>So here&#8217;s to the first post, the stepping stone into a new adventure.</p>
