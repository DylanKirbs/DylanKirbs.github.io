There's never really a "right time" to start something new, so I just went for it. **Welcome** to yet another rebuild of my personal website.

I've always liked the idea of having a space that's fully mine; no templates, no platforms, just something I understand from top to bottom.

I've also been spending an exorbitant amount of time writing LaTeX reports and figures maybe I could put my creative writing skills to better use. So, here we are.

This isn't my first attempt, and it probably won't be my last. My old site was a locally hosted WordPress site that I built with a static dump plugin and pushed to GitHub pages, and the one before that was a static Jekyll setup on GitHub Pages, super simple, reliable, and a good intro to the basics. But this time I wanted something more flexible, something I could actually build on. So I went with React and a modern toolchain. It's not perfect, but it's mine, and it works.

I don't really consider myself a "web dev" (I spend most of my time in systems and backend work) but I like learning new tools when there's a reason to.

Think of this site as a mix of notes, experiments, and personal projects. It'll change over time - hopefully in the right direction - and maybe it'll even be useful to someone else along the way.

Anyway, here we are. A fresh start, a bit of new tech, and a space to keep building.
