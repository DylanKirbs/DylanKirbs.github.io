For example, I had never used Vim before, my primary editor was Visual Studio Code, but now that I&#8217;m used to it, I have really come to enjoy it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another uniquely enjoyable experience was learning Jasmin and writing stack machine assembly code for the JVM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Worked Experience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have had the fortune to be exposed to many amazing opportunities. As well as volunteer work for the Social Impact Division of SU, I have worked for two non-profit organisations, namely Jeppe Boats and Blades (JBB) and The Institute for Mindfulness South Africa (IMISA).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JBB<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Our mission as Jeppe Boats and Blades is to equip Jeppe Rowing with the equipment needed to compete at the highest level and to make a positive impact on the sport of rowing at national and international levels. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe that Jeppe, as a public school, is best placed to lead the way by using the sport of rowing as a means to develop young people, regardless of their background and circumstance. We aim to facilitate an opportunity to all students, through their personal development and collective experiences, to grow into strong leaders who can build a future for all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeppe Boats and Blades (\u201cJBB\u201d) is a voluntary association of interested persons instituted and established for the sole and express purpose of fundraising for the Jeppe High School for Boys (\u201cJHS\u201d) rowing club. JBB has the specific goal of purchasing boats, blades and any other equipment that will allow Jeppe Rowing to compete in various inter-school rowing regattas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are committed to introducing more boys to rowing and facilitating the opportunity for them to compete with high end equipment. This ultimately compliments the efforts they make and has a direct impact on the potential outcome of every race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst working on our core purpose we\u2019ve had the privilege of meeting oarsmen who rowed for Jeppe between 1958 (the year Dr Tomlinson, an ex-Jeppe boy himself, initiated schoolboy rowing in Gauteng) and the current season. We have seen a community of oarsmen who, regardless of age, share the Jeppe values that we recognize in ourselves, and which is summed up in the school\u2019s motto, \u201cnothing is too difficult for the brave.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through our collective actions we have seen that when a group of people come together with a common goal, there is nothing that can stand in their way.<\/p>\n<cite>Jeppe Boats and Blades Mission from the <a href=\"http:\/\/whiskylive.co.za\/jeppe-boats\/\">WhiskyLive<\/a> page.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>My involvement was setting up the JBB website, which was my first time working with WordPress.
